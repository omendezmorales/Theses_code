## Theses code

This repo contains the code of both my [Master of Science][m] and [Professional Doctorate in Engineering][pd] (see page 26 & 27).

[m]: http://swerl.tudelft.nl/bin/view/Main/OrlandoMendez

[pd]: https://github.com/omendezmorales/Theses_code/blob/master/pdeng/Project%20booklet%202009.pdf

The idea is to present a high-level overview of the problem to solve, then a deployment's view of the components proposed in each solution, the depedencies, and finally the code itself.
